Reflection Questions:

1. Compare your original draft and the final draft. What is the biggest difference between the two?

	I moved a method from one class to another and added some other useful methods to support functionality.

2. What did you have to change and why did you have to change it? If not, explain how you made your decisions in designing.

	I moved the check answer from QuizTester to Question because QuizTester should not have access to the data of Question.

3. Did you re-use your code from ImplementingDesign1? How much did you have to change it if so? (If not, then please explain why)

	Yes, I did reuse the Quiz and Question classes, however, I had to change the ArrayLists to HashMaps to enable easy selection of 
	objects by their id's. I also added necessary methods to this problem and removed unnecessary ones from the last problem.

4. Select one or more specific design principles and discuss how they relate to the your experience in designing and implementing the code for this assignment.

	1b. My final design changed from the first to make sure each class had access to ONLY the data they needed.
