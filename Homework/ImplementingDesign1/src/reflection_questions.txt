Reflection Questions:

1.A In your implementation could you replace Questions with Strings (yes or no)? 

Yes

1.B Why or why not? (2-3 sentences)

The question id's are never explicitly used and are therefore unnecessary in a program of this level. In a higher functioning 
program it may have been necessary to create a question class, but here it just uses extra data.

2.A. What data type did you use to represent the 1 to many relationship between QuizMain and Question? (provide type)

ArrayList<Question>

2.B. What is another type could you have used? (provide type) 

HashMap<Integer,Question>

2.C. Would that have made the code better or worse? Why? (2-3 sentences)

If I used a HashMap rather than an ArrayList then the id data field in the question class would
no longer be needed. This could be seen as making the code easier to use.
